Specific New Feature To Be Added: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. Generate a detailed implementation plan of how to add a new "Complexity Reason" feature to the application that, for the generated report, adds a new column to the "Database Stored Procedures & Triggers" HTNL report table called "ComplexityReason", ensuring that this field is captured in the MongoDB database during the legacy relational-based application's codebase capture phase and the appropriate changes are made to Zod schemas and SourcesRepository implementations, interfaces and model to accomodate this. The database will be re-created from scratch so there is no need to provide migration scripts.
