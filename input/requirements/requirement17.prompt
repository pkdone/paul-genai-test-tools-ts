Adding New Feature: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. Generate a detailed implementation plan of how to add a new feature to the application that, for the generated report, adds a new column to the "Database Stored Procedures & Triggers" table called "ComplexityReason", ensuring that this field is captured in the database during the codebase capture phase and the appropriate changes are made to Zod schemas and SourcesRepository implementations, interfaces and model to accomodate this.
