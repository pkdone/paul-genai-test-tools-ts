Improve handling of App Summary Categories. Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block.

The code builds prompts for an LLM to get various insights for an application, including:

 * "appDescription"
 * "boundedContexts"
 * "businessEntities"
 * "businessProcesses"
 * "technologies";

 The current code hanging off the source code folder `src/features/insights` is problematic in multiple ways, including:

  * Defines schema mappings in multiple places with some duplication
  * The declarations and use of "appDescription" | "boundedContexts" | "businessEntities" | "businessProcesses" | "technologies"  happen in multiple places in subtley different ways including defining types and interfaces, defining keys for records, defining promptTypes,e tc. 

I've added `// TODO:` comments for examples of problematic parts of the code.

Your job is to generate a full plan of code improvements (to be given to a senior developer to implement) to address the issues and then how to validate that the improved code is still fit for purpose and correct.

In your plan, include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
