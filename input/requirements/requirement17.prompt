Poor Unit Test Structure: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The unit test files that exist in the project no longer match the source files they are testing, in many places. Identify any places that the unit test files need to be moved, renamed, split up or converged to better match the source structure. Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs these improvements with suggestions on how to improve. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
