Interfaces Vs Types: Act as a programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. Using TypeScript best practices for when to use Interfaces vs Types, highlight where these best practices are not being adopted, describing why, and recommend how to resolve. This advice should include whether to define these types/interfaces within existing source code files containing other code or to have them in their own types file or folder. Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs these improvements with suggestions on how to improve. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
