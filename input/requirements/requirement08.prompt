Type Assertions Vs Guards: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. Identify any places in the code where a type assertion with `as` is being used, when it would be better to use a type guard instead. Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs these improvements with suggestions on how to improve. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
