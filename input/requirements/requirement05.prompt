Use of `any`: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. Identify what parts of the code uses the TypeScript `any` feature (explicitly or implicitly) where there is a better option to use more strongly typed code. Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs these improvements with suggestions on how to improve. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
