Bad Groupings: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. Identify the top 10 key areas to improve the source code layout and groupings in terms of keeping logically related code in the same class or at least the same sub-folder, while at the same time avoiding indivudal source files from becoming too large and doing too many things in one place. Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs these improvements with suggestions on how to improve. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
