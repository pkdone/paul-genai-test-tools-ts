Modern JavaScript/TypeScript: Act as a programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. Identify any parts of code which aren't fully leveraging the capabilities of the more modern aspects of newer versions of JavaScript up to the 14th Edition of ECMAScript (ECMAScript 2023) and the newer versions of TypeScript (if there is ambiguity, favor TypeScript over JavaScript). Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs these improvements with suggestions on how to improve. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
