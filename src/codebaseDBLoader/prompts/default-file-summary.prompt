Act as a programmer. Take the content of an application source file shown below in the section marked 'CONTENT' and for this content, return a JSON response containing data which includes a detailed definition of its purpose (you must write at least 4 sentences for this purpose), a detailed definition of its implementation (you must write at least 3 sentences for this implementation) and the type of direct database integration via a driver/library/API it employs, if any (stating the mechanism used in capitals, or NONE if no code does not interact with a database directly) and a description of the database integration.

In the JSON response, do not include any explanations or markdown, only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON response following this format without deviation:
{
  "purpose": "<purpose>",
  "implementation": "<implementation>",
  "databaseIntegration": {
    "mechanism": "<mechanism>",
    "description": "<description>"
  }
}

NEVER use Markdown code blocks to wrap the JSON in your response.
