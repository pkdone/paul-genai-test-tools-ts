    - Code contains SQL code (set mechanism: 'SQL')
    - Code uses a database driver or library (set mechanism: 'DRIVER')
    - Code uses a database Object-Relational-Mapper (ORM) like JPA, TopLink, Hibernate, etc, (set mechanism: 'ORM')
    - Code uses a Spring Data API (set mechanism: 'SPRING-DATA')
    - Code has a Java class integrating with a database by an Enterprise Java Bean (EJB), which also could be CMP or BMP based (set mechanism: 'EJB')
    - Code uses a 3rd party framework/library for database access (set mechanism: 'OTHER')
